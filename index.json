	"content": "Some features of 90.1-2019 Appendix G that have not yet been implemenented into the baseline automation are as follows:\nBaseline humidification is same as user model in the current tool. In some cases the baseline is required to be changed to adiabatic humidification. This has not been implemented. Baseline dehumidification is same as user model in the current tool. For constant volume systems, Appendix G indicates that only 25% of the system reheat energy shall be included in the budget building performance. This is not yet implemented, and must be handled via post-processing or an EMS applied to the Baseline model. Baseline transformer efficiencies have not been implemented. Where service water heater systems in the user model are comprised of multiple distributed systems, the Appendix G model is required to use a single central system. The conversion to a central system has not yet been implemented. For models where design ventilation rates are greater than that required by code, then the rules of Appendix G state that the Baseline ventilation rate shall be based on the building code, and will be lower than the user model. The ability to model this difference has not yet been implemented. Some Appendix G requirements for district energy systems have not yet been implemented. Efficiency requirements for motors serving miscellaneous electrical equipment have not yet been implemented. Efficiency requirements for commercial refrigeration equipment have not yet been implemented. The baseline requirement has not yet been implemented where lab exhaust fans must be modeled as constant horsepower, reflecting constant-volume stack discharge with outdoor air bypass. The rules of the 2016 version of 90.1 Appendix G are very similar to the 2019 version. Some differences are as follows:\nIn 2016, if Proposed model has combined space/SWH system, the Baseline shall use separate systems. In 2019, a single central SWH system is to be used. This is similar, but maybe not identical to the 2016 version. The 2019 version has rules to allow credit for receptacle control, which are not present in the 2016 version. In 2016, the infiltration leakage rate is the same in Proposed and Baseline, at 0.4 cfm/sf at 0.3 in water. In 2019, the Proposed model is specified as 0.6 cfm/sf and the Baseline is at 1.0 cfm/sf at 0.3 in water. "

The API method provides great flexibility for creating customized modeling workflow.

Make adjustments to the model: Change the window-to-wall ratio to 60% (adding a span glazings on every wall) Add overhangs to the south facade of the model. General the baseline model by calling the API method. At the end of the script, the standard object calls a function model_create_prm_stable_baseline_building is the API function that generates the baseline model.\nstandard.model_create_prm_stable_baseline_building(model, climate_zone, hvac_bldg_type, wwr_bldg_type, swh_bldg_type, baseline_dir, run_all_orients=false, unmet_load_hours_check=true, debug=false) A detail description of the arguments can be found in the API document.\nUser data In PRM routines, one additional step allows users to add code compliance-specific data to the baseline generation workflow. Data missing in most building energy models, such as space type for a space, lighting space type for space lighting, or motor horsepower for electric equipment, can be added to the user data before calling the API. The use of the user data can be found in the Add compliance data section.\n# Create PRM object standard = Standard.build(\u0026#39;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#39;) baseline_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; # Converts user data from .csv file to .json file json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(\u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/user_data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#{baseline_dir}\u0026#34;) # Load the user data json files into the PRM routine. standard.load_userdata_to_standards_database(json_path) # Generate baseline standard.model_create_prm_stable_baseline_building(model, climate_zone, hvac_bldg_type, wwr_bldg_type, swh_bldg_type, baseline_dir, run_all_orients=false, unmet_load_hours_check=true, debug=false) The above script first creates the PRM object from OpenStudio Standards, then converts the data from .csv to .json and loads them into the object before generating the baseline. It is important to convert the CSV to JSON before loading them to the PRM object. The API documents gives a more detail description of the function convert_userdata_csv_to_json and load_userdata_to_standards_database.\nBaseline outputs A successful baseline generation creates several baseline model(s) and folders under the baseline_dir as shown in the image below. SR_[NUMBER]: Several folders are generated and saved in the baseline_dir. They typically start with SR_ and ends with a number or PROP. These folders contain the energy model and their sizing run outputs. The number records the index of the sizing run. PROP indicates a sizing run on a proposed model. A more detailed description of the baseline generation steps is described in the API document.\nuser_data_json: The user_data_json saves all user-defined data in JSON format. The list includes the complete set of user data regardless there is data or not.\nfinal.osm: A baseline OpenStudio model at 0 rotation degrees.\nfinal_NUM.idf: Depending on whether the baseline model case meets the G3.1(5).a building rotation requirements, the baseline generation produces one or four EnergyPlus files. If there are no rotations, the folder would only contain one final.idf; else, there would befinal_0.idf, final_90.idf, final_180.idf, and final_270.idf.\n"

The lighting space type is also used for a number of other purposes in the baseline generation, including: determining special requirements for computer rooms and laboratories, identifying residential spaces, and determining applicability of receptacle control measures according to space type.\nThe lighting space type can also be assigned using the User Compliance Data files for Space Type and Space. If the User Compliance Data files contain lighting space type assignments, there is a hierachy for determining the final assignments:\nuser_data_space is first priority user_data_space_type is second priority StandardsSpaceType property of the SpaceType objest is lowest priority It is possible to have lighting space type identified at the user_data_space level for some spaces and at either the user_data_space_type level or SpaceType:StandardsSpaceType level for other spaces.\nValid entries for StandardsSpaceType are listed below.

The program will back-calculate the uncontrolled lighting schedules for the Baseline model based on the occupancy sensor reduction values in Appendix G Table G3.7.\nThe user model needs to have a fully defined HVAC system. Most of the HVAC objects are deleted when the Appendix G Baseline is created, but some information is taken from the user model and transferred to the Baselne. This includes the following:\nZone ventilation rates. For zones that require demand control ventilation in the baseline model, ventilation must be provided in terms of both flow per area and flow per person. The program will issue a warning if this is not done. Fan schedules Proportion of fan power for supply, return, and relief fans "

Each lighting space type entered into the user_data_space_type.csv file must be paired with a fraction value to indicate the percentage of the floor area for spaces that is to be assigned to that lighting space type.\nFor example, consider a space type named CoreOffice, that contains 25% private office, 50% open office, and 25% corridor. The entries in the user_data_space_type.csv file would be as follows:\nname num_std_ltg_types std_ltg_type01 std_ltg_type_frac01 std_ltg_type02 std_ltg_type_frac02 std_ltg_type03 std_ltg_type_frac03 CoreOffice 3 office - enclosed \u0026lt;= 250 sf 0.25 office - open 0.50 corridor - all other 0.25 The resulting baseline will have a weighted average lighting power of the three assigned lighting spacetypes based on the fractions in the table. Space types not listed in the table will default to the StandardsSpaceType property of the SpaceType object.\nAn error will result if the fractions supplied by the user do not add up to 1.0.\nA similar capability exists for Space objects through the user_data_space.csv file.\n"

Many of them have specific enum values. For a successful generation, these arguments need to match their enum values.\nThis instruction will walk through the argument list, so this API call can be customized for any purpose and building cases.\nThis API function is a primary function to generate baseline models. The process takes a user-created OpenStudio model and several user-defined arguments and produce a PRM baseline model.\nStep 1: Check proposed model graph LR; A(Check proposed model) --\u003e|check severe errors and unmet load hours| B{Decision} B --\u003e|Passed| C(Create four baseline models) B --\u003e|Failed| D(Create one baseline model) The simulation results in this step will be saved in the folder SR_PROP0.\nStep 2: Adjust envelope and internal loads In this step, the function starts adjusting the envelope and internal loads based on the information stored in the method arguments and user-supplied model. In addition, this step also prepares HVAC systems for a sizing run.\ngraph LR; A(Adjust Internal Loads) --\u003e|Remove external shades| B(Shades) A --\u003e|Apply compliacne window to wall ratio| C(WWR) A --\u003e|Apply compliance skylight to root ratio| D(SRR) A --\u003e|Apply compliance lighting power density| E(LPD) A --\u003e|Adjust schedule to handle occupancy sensors| F(Schedule) A --\u003e|Remove daylighting| G(Daylight) A --\u003e|Replace constructions| H(Constructions) A --\u003e|Add HVAC and sizing info| I(HVAC) After all the above is applied, a sizing run is conducted and labeled as SR1 in the output directory.\nStep 3: Fine tune HVAC system parameters 1 Based on the sizing run results in the SR1 folder, this step will fine-tune the HVAC parameters based on the ASHRAE 90.1 appendix G specifications.\ngraph LR; A(HVAC System) --\u003e|Tune baseline air loop fan power| B(Airloop Fans) A --\u003e|Tune baseline zone fan power| C(Zone Fans) A --\u003e|Tune boilers| D(Boilers) A --\u003e|Tune chillers| E(Chllers) A --\u003e|Tune cooling towers| F(CoolingTowers) After all the above steps are completed, a second sizing run is conducted and labeled as SR2 in the output directory. In this run, several key metrics in the HVAC system will be determined, such as the capacity of the chillers and loop flow rates.\nStep 4: Fine tune HVAC system parameters 2 This step further fine-tunes some parameters in the HVAC components. graph LR; A(HVAC Component) --\u003e|Tune component efficiency| B(Efficiency) A --\u003e|Set demand control ventilation| C(DCV) A --\u003e|Tune pump power and controls| D(Pump) A third sizing run is conducted after this step and labeled as SR3 in the output directory. The third sizing run is the final sizing run to refine size-dependent values, including the secondary flow rate in the parallel PIU reheat terminal and the maximum flow rate in the air terminal.\nAfter these four steps, baseline model(s) will be generated in the output directory. The output directory is an argument the user provides when calling this function. In the next section, we will give a detail explanation of these arguments.\n- model model is the OpenStudio model. A typical way to load an OpenStudio model is through the version translator.\nmodel_path = \u0026#39;\\some_path\\some_os_model.osm\u0026#39; translator = OpenStudio::OSVersion::VersionTranslator.new model = translator.loadModel(model_path).get - climate_zone The climate_zone shall be one of the strings from the list below:\nASHRAE 169-2013-0A ASHRAE 169-2013-0B ASHRAE 169-2013-1A ASHRAE 169-2013-1B ASHRAE 169-2013-2A ASHRAE 169-2013-2B ASHRAE 169-2013-3A ASHRAE 169-2013-3B ASHRAE 169-2013-3C ASHRAE 169-2013-4A ASHRAE 169-2013-4B ASHRAE 169-2013-4C ASHRAE 169-2013-5A ASHRAE 169-2013-5B ASHRAE 169-2013-5C ASHRAE 169-2013-6A ASHRAE 169-2013-6B ASHRAE 169-2013-7A ASHRAE 169-2013-7B ASHRAE 169-2013-8A ASHRAE 169-2013-8B - default_hvac_bldg_type The default_hvac_bldg_type shall be one of the strings in the list below:\nheated only storage hospital public assembly retail other nonresidential residential unconditioned - default_wwr_bldg_type The default_wwr_bldg_type shall be one of the strings in the list below:\nWarehouse (nonrefrigerated) School (secondary and university) School (primary) Retail (strip mall) Retail (stand alone) Restaurant (quick service) Restaurant (full serivce) Office \u0026gt; 50,000 sq ft Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft Office 5,000 to 50,000 sq ft Hotel/motel \u0026gt; 75 rooms Hotel/motel \u0026lt;= 75 rooms Hospital Healthcare (outpatient) Grocery store All other - default_swh_bldg_type The default_swh_bldg_type shall be one of the strings in the list below:\nWorkshop Warehouse Transportation Town hall Sport arena School/university Retail Religious facility Post office Police station Performing arts theater Penitentiary Parking garage Office Museum Multifamily Motion picture theater Motel Manufacturing facility Library Hotel Hospital and outpatient surgery center Health-care clinic Gymnasium Grocery store Fire station Exercise center Domitory Dining:Family Dining: Cafeteria/fast food Dining: Bar lounge/leisure Courthouse Convention center Convenience store Automotive facility All others - output_dir output_dir is a mandatory field that specifies the directory to save all sizing runs. When applying the PRM method to a proposed model, OSSTD will perform several sizing runs. These sizing runs are usually saved in a directory specified in sizing_run_dir. In addition, the generated baseline model .idf and .osm will also be saved in this directory.\n- unmet_load_hours unmet_load_hours is a flag that checks whether a model can successfully run an annual simulation and whether its annual unmet load hours meet the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G requirements. The default value for this flag is true.\nCautious when setting the unmet_load_hours to false. This could result in wrong baseline models or crash the baseline generation process.\n- debug debug default is set to false. This argument has no impact on the current PRM generation and is part of the future implementation. Any API calls set this field to false or ignore this argument.\nconvert_userdata_csv_to_json The function converts user data from CSV format to JSON format, and it is typically called before loading the user data before baseline generation.\nstandard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) userdata_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/user_data\u0026#34; output_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; # Converts user data from .csv file to .json file json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(userdata_dir, output_dir) The function has two arguments, userdata_dir and output_dir. The process first loads all the default user data templates as json, then grabs all the user CSV files saved in the userdata_dir and inserts data from the csv files into the json data. Lastly, the function saves the json to the output_dir in the user_data_json folder.\n- userdata_dir This argument shall be a valid directory string that points to the folder where all user data csv is saved. An example can be:\n\u0026#34;C:\\\\documents\\\\my_user_data\u0026#34; - output_dir This argument shall be a valid directory string that points to the folder where all user data json is saved. An example can be:\n\u0026#34;C:\\\\documents\\\\user_data_json\u0026#34; load_userdata_to_standards_database The function loads the user data folder into the 90.1-PRM-2019 instance. A typical workflow will call convert_userdata_csv_to_json first to convert all user data from csv to json and then call load_userdata_to_standards_database to load the json into the workflow.\nstandard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) userdata_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/user_data\u0026#34; output_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; # Converts user data from .csv file to .json file json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(userdata_dir, output_dir) standard.load_userdata_to_standards_database(json_path) json_path shall be a valid directory string that points to the folder where all user data json is saved.\n"

Each building type maps to a window-to-wall ratio.\nBuilding Area Types Baseline building vertical fenestration percentage of gross-above-grade wall area Grocery store 7% Warehouse (nonrefrigerated) 6% School (secondary and university) 22% School (primary) 22% Retail (strip mall) 20% Retail (stand alone) 11% Restaurant (quick service) 34% Restaurant (full serivce) 24% Office \u0026gt; 50,000 sq ft 40% Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft 19% Office 5,000 to 50,000 sq ft 31% Hotel/motel \u0026gt; 75 rooms 34% Hotel/motel \u0026lt;= 75 rooms 24% Hospital 27% Healthcare (outpatient) 21% All other 40% The mapping is shown in the above table. Once the function identifies the correct building area, it will apply the window-to-wall ratio to the entire model.\nFunction workflow graph LR; A(Model) --\u003e|Loop| B(Spaces) B --\u003e|Apply building area type| C(BAT) B --\u003e|Surface conditioning category| D{Condition} D --\u003e|Conditioned space| E(Surfaces) C --\u003e|Target WWR| F(Adjust Ratio) E --\u003e|Existing WWR| F(Adjust WWR) How to use As the workflow diagram indicated, the function checks each zone and surface to determine its conditioned type. The conditioned type of a zone is determined after model sizing simulation. Therefore, it is critical to note that this function will only work after a successful full-year simulation or sizing run. To do that, follow the script below before calling the function.\n# Initiate the standard to PRM and load the model (model needs to be v3.4 or lower) standard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) translator = OpenStudio::OSVersion::VersionTranslator.new model = translator.loadModel(model_path).get # Make a copy of the model user_model = BTAP::FileIO.deep_copy(model) # Run annual simulation standard.model_run_simulation_and_log_errors(user_model, run_dir = \u0026#34;#{prototype_dir}/PROP\u0026#34;) # Modify the window to wall ratio. result, wwr_info = standard.model_apply_prm_baseline_window_to_wall_ratio(user_model, climate_zone, wwr_building_type: wwr_building_type) If the model is not simulated, this function can still run. However, it will not apply a target WWR to the model because it cannot find any conditioned surface to adjust WWR.\nFunction behavior It is essential to understand the function behaviors before calling this function.\nIf the target WWR is smaller than the model overall WWR, the function will proportionally reduce the size of every window while keeping their center coordinates fixed If the target WWR is greater than the model overall WWR, the function will: remove all windows in surfaces and add new ones to meet the required WWR. This step will only apply to surfaces that have windows Plenums (including air loop supply and return plenums) are not considered in the WWR expanding algorithm. If surfaces with windows reach a 90% WWR, the total gross WWR of the building is still smaller than the target WWR. The function will create new windows on every other surface to meet the target WWR for the building. The size of new windows should be proportional to their host surface. If there are doors on the surface, the maximum WWR for the surface will readjust to ensure the total fenestration area and doors are 90% of the surface area. Input arguments user_model user_model shall be the OpenStudio model object (OpenStudio::Model::Model) that contains a complete description of a building energy model in .osm format.\nclimate_zone climate_zone is a String data. However, it is no longer used in the ASHRAE 90.1 2019 PRM method, so it is OK to type in an empty string.\nwwr_building_type wwr_building_type is a hash key, and the value shall be user-defined. The default is nil. The wwr_building_type shall be a string taken from the list below:\nWarehouse (nonrefrigerated) School (secondary and university) School (primary) Retail (strip mall) Retail (stand alone) Restaurant (quick service) Restaurant (full serivce) Office \u0026gt; 50,000 sq ft Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft Office 5,000 to 50,000 sq ft Hotel/motel \u0026gt; 75 rooms Hotel/motel \u0026lt;= 75 rooms Hospital Healthcare (outpatient) Grocery store All other It is important to keep the wwr_building_type string identical to the list above. Otherwise, the function will set the target building WWR to 40%.\nOutput values result The result is a boolean. true indicates a successful generation and false otherwise.\nwwr_info The wwr_info is a hash map that maps the wwr_building_type to its correspondent target wwr, which is applied when altering the model window-to-wall ratio.\n{\u0026#34;Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft\u0026#34;=\u0026gt;19.0} Multi building area type handling One feature of the PRM routine is the capability of handling multiple building area types in one energy model. For example, if an energy model is simulating a building mixed with retail (strip mall) and offices (\u0026gt;50,000 sq ft). The baseline vertical fenestration percentage requirements differ for these two building area types. Previously, modelers had to manually adjust the generated baseline model to meet the compliance request. In the new workflow, we introduce the user data to handle this situation in the baseline generation runtime.\nCreate user data To do that, we need to create user data. The example we are using is a typical small office model. In this model, we will identify one space as a retail (strip mall) space and the rest are an office (\u0026gt;50,000 sq ft).\nIn this example, we will edit the userdata_space file in a spreadsheet.\nIt is recommended to edit the file in a spreadsheet cause this can avoid any special characters in the string misidentified by the OSSTD-PRM. In this case, Office \u0026gt; 50,000 sq ft can be mis-identified into two columns as Office \u0026gt; 50 and 000 sq ft.\nOnce the user data is set, save the file as a .csv into a user_data folder.\nSet up the script Let\u0026rsquo;s first set up basic data and load the user energy model\n# Set up directories model_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; user_model_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/source\u0026#34; user_model_name = \u0026#39;proposed_model.osm\u0026#39; user_data_path = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/user_data\u0026#34; # Set up basic parameters climate_zone = \u0026#34;ASHRAE 169-2013-4A\u0026#34; wwr_building_type = \u0026#34;Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft\u0026#34; # load user model translator = OpenStudio::OSVersion::VersionTranslator.new model = translator.loadModel(\u0026#34;#{user_model_dir}/#{user_model_name}\u0026#34;).get user_model = BTAP::FileIO.deep_copy(model) # Initialize the standard routine standard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) Now we have everything we need, let\u0026rsquo;s load the user data\n# Convert the .csv files into json files and save the json files into model_dir json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(user_data_path, model_dir) # load the user data into standard object instance standard.load_userdata_to_standards_database(json_path) # Add the user data to the user model. standard.handle_multi_building_area_types(user_model, climate_zone, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, wwr_building_type, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, {}) The three lines of code above accomplished three goals:\nConvert the .csv files into JSON files and save the JSON files into model_dir Load the user data into a Standard object instance Call the Standard instance to add user data to the user energy model. The above three steps are crucial to the overall process. The function handle_multi_building_area_types() has six arguments. However, in this example, we only focus on the WWR API function. So supplying user_model, climate_zone, and wwr_building_type and setting the other argument to empty values is sufficient for our next step.\nRun window to wall ratio API # Run a simulation standard.model_run_simulation_and_log_errors(user_model, run_dir = \u0026#34;#{prototype_dir}/PROP\u0026#34;) # Adjust window to wall ratio result, wwr_info = standard.model_apply_prm_baseline_window_to_wall_ratio(user_model, climate_zone, wwr_building_type: wwr_building_type) # Save model user_model.save(OpenStudio::Path.new(\u0026#34;#{prototype_dir}/wwr_output.osm\u0026#34;), true) In the above three lines, the Standard first run an annual simulation of the model to ensure the model is correct and produces a sizing script for analyzing the space conditioning category. Then the model_apply_prm_baseline_window_to_wall_ratio function applies the WWR adjustment to the user energy model.\nOpen the model in the OpenStudio Application, and you can see the Perimeter_ZN_2 space is adjusted to 19% WWR, and the rest are adjusted to 40% WWR.\n"
