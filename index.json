	"content": "Chapter 1 What is OSSTD-PRM? The purpose of this documentation is to serve as a comprehensive reference for OSSTD-PRM, a tool that can facilitate the process of complying with ASHRAE Standard 90.1. It can help eliminate unintentional errors, intentional \u0026ldquo;cheating\u0026rdquo; and allow the modelers to spend more time and project budget evaluating energy-efficiency design and operation strategies.\nOpenStudio Standards (OSSTD) is a Ruby Gem library that extends the OpenStudio SDK. It is a collection of measures and resources that automate the construction of typical building models in OpenStudio format, provide higher level methods to create OpenStudio models from existing geometry as well as the transformations associated with ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Appendix G Performance Rating Method (PRM), a commonly exercised transformation that supports code compliance, green certifications, and utility incentive calculations.\nOSSTD-PRM is an umbrella term or a package created to automate the generation of a code baseline model (and potentially a proposed model in future) from an existing geometry. It currently includes “Create ASHRAE 90.1-2019 PRM Model” measure to automatically generate the baseline model according to the rules of the 2019 version of the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Performance Rating Method.\nThe following sections provide a. An Introduction to ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G (PRM) that OSSTD-PRM is based on along with the benefits and use-cases of OSSTD-PRM, b. Getting Started resources and c. the User Guide.\n"

	"content": "ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Performance Rating Method (PRM) The ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Performance Rating Method can be used to demonstrate compliance with the standard and to rate the energy efficiency of commercial and high-rise residential buildings with designs that exceed the requirements of Standard 90.1.\nKey Features:\nEvaluate building energy performance using annual simulation Demonstrate code compliance and allowance for trade-offs after meeting mandatory requirements Quantify performance in excess of the standard ASHRAE 90.1 Stable Baseline Appendix G uses a stable baseline approach with efficiency levels set at values that are not intended to be updated with each new addition of the code. Instead, the proposed building energy performance needs to exceed that of the baseline by an amount commensurate with the code year being evaluated.\nBackground\nThese changes came about with the modeling procedures in the 2016 standard, that are fundamentally different from previous versions in that the baseline building is fixed to be roughly equal in stringency to Standard 90.1-2004 and compliance is determined through a metric called Performance Cost Index (PCI). Prior to 2016, the Appendix G baseline building stringency changed with each version of Standard 90.1 and sometimes with each addendum that created much confusion for software developers, energy modelers and program administrators. For many use-cases, an excessive amount of time was spent creating the baseline building and verifying its correctness. With the new procedure, the intent is that the baseline building stringency does not change. Instead, as the standard becomes more stringent, a greater level of improvement over the stable baseline is required. The 2004 version of the standard has been used for defining the baseline performance. This version of the standard has been used as a benchmark by ASHRAE and the US DOE for evaluating the stringency of more recent versions of Standard 90.1 and now it is used as a stable baseline for all performance calculations. Each consecutive version of the Standard would update the target PCI without modifying the stringency of the baseline building requirements. Appendix G Moving Baseline vs. Stable Baseline The image below compares the Appendix G \u0026ldquo;moving baseline\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;stable baseline\u0026rdquo;.\n"

For example:\nrequire `openstudio` require `openstudio-standard` model_path = \u0026#39;C:\\demo\\output\\\\\u0026#39; save_path = \u0026#39;C:\\demo\\source\\\\\u0026#39; base_model = \u0026#39;test_model.osm\u0026#39; modified_model = \u0026#39;modified_model_demo.osm\u0026#39; translator = OpenStudio::OSVersion::VersionTranslator.new model = translator.loadModel(model_path + base_model).get # Adjust window to wall ratio to 60% model.getSurfaces.each do |ss| unless ss.subSurfaces.empty? orig_construction = ss.subSurfaces[0].construction.get ss.subSurfaces.sort.each(\u0026amp;:remove) new_window = ss.setWindowToWallRatio(0.6, 0.8, true).get new_window.setConstruction(orig_construction) end end # Add overhangs on south facade. model.getSubSurfaces.each do |s| absoluteAzimuth = OpenStudio.convert(s.azimuth, \u0026#39;rad\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;deg\u0026#39;).get + s.space.get.directionofRelativeNorth + model.getBuilding.northAxis absoluteAzimuth -= 360.0 until absoluteAzimuth \u0026lt; 360.0 next if !((absoluteAzimuth \u0026gt;= 135.0) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (absoluteAzimuth \u0026lt; 225.0)) new_overhang = s.addOverhangByProjectionFactor(0.8, 0) end # Build the standard PRM routine standard = Standard.build(\u0026#39;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#39;) baseline_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; hvac_bldg_type = \u0026#39;other nonresidential\u0026#39; wwr_bldg_type = \u0026#39;Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft\u0026#39; swh_bldg_type = \u0026#39;Office\u0026#39; standard.model_create_prm_stable_baseline_building(model, climate_zone, hvac_bldg_type, wwr_bldg_type, swh_bldg_type, baseline_dir, run_all_orients=false, unmet_load_hours_check=true, debug=false) What the script above did was:\nLoad an OSM model - it could be any model created as a proposed model for creating a baseline system. Make adjustments to the model. Change the window-to-wall ratio to 60% (adding a span glazing on every wall). Add overhangs to the south facade of the model. Generate the baseline model by calling the API method. At the end of the script, the standard object calls a function model_create_prm_stable_baseline_building is the API function that generates the baseline model.\nstandard.model_create_prm_stable_baseline_building(model, climate_zone, hvac_bldg_type, wwr_bldg_type, swh_bldg_type, baseline_dir, run_all_orients=false, unmet_load_hours_check=true, debug=false) A detail description of the arguments can be found in the API document.\nUser data In PRM routines, one additional step allows users to add code compliance-specific data to the baseline generation workflow. Data missing in most building energy models, such as space type for a space, lighting space type for space lighting, or motor horsepower for electric equipment, can be added to the user data before calling the API. The use of the user data can be found in the Add compliance data section.\n# Create PRM object standard = Standard.build(\u0026#39;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#39;) baseline_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; # Converts user data from .csv file to .json file json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(\u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/user_data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#{baseline_dir}\u0026#34;) # Load the user data json files into the PRM routine. standard.load_userdata_to_standards_database(json_path) # Generate baseline standard.model_create_prm_stable_baseline_building(model, climate_zone, hvac_bldg_type, wwr_bldg_type, swh_bldg_type, baseline_dir, run_all_orients=false, unmet_load_hours_check=true, debug=false) The above script first creates the PRM object from OpenStudio Standards, then converts the data from .csv to .json and loads them into the object before generating the baseline. It is important to convert the CSV to JSON before loading them to the PRM object. The API documents gives a more detail description of the function convert_userdata_csv_to_json and load_userdata_to_standards_database.\nBaseline outputs A successful baseline generation creates several baseline model(s) and folders under the baseline_dir as shown in the image below. SR_[NUMBER]: Several folders are generated and saved in the baseline_dir. They typically start with SR_ and ends with a number or PROP. These folders contain the energy model and their sizing run outputs. The number records the index of the sizing run. PROP indicates a sizing run on a proposed model. A more detailed description of the baseline generation steps is described in the API document.\nuser_data_json: The user_data_json saves all user-defined data in JSON format. The list includes the complete set of user data regardless there is data or not.\nfinal.osm: A baseline OpenStudio model at 0 rotation degrees.\nfinal_NUM.idf: Depending on whether the baseline model case meets the G3.1(5).a building rotation requirements, the baseline generation produces one or four EnergyPlus files. If there are no rotations, the folder would only contain one final.idf; else, there would befinal_0.idf, final_90.idf, final_180.idf, and final_270.idf.\n"

In this case, we will need to provide more information for the PRM function so it can properly handle the multi-building types scenario. To do that, we will need to use the userdata_space.csv. In the demo3 zip file, there is a user_data folder. Inside this folder, we have a userdata_space.csv file. Let\u0026rsquo;s open the file to inspect.\nIn the file (as shown in the image), we can see all perimeter zones on the first floor are set to Retail (strip mall) WWR building type. For lighting space type, the Perimeter_bot_ZN_2 is set to retail mall concourse and the other spaces are set to retail - whole building.

The generated_files folder would contain the output .osm files, reports that should reflect the Output shown here.\nB. Using OS SDK using CLI Setup Local Directory: Set up the files from demo3 folder in a local directory. One such example of the folder structure is shown in Run the measure section. For this demo, place the userdata_space.csv in the directory as well.\nEdit OSW File: Open the .osw file created initially (Refer to Run the measure section). Update the project inputs and parameters as follows. Execute: Open Command Prompt as an administrator and type the following command with paths to the openstudio\\bin and the OSW directories.\nC:\\openstudio-3.6.1\\bin\\openstudio.exe run -w \u0026#34;C:\\Users\\sample_user\\demo3\\test.osw\u0026#34; Make sure you change the openstudio version based on what is installed on your system, for example 3.6.0 instead of 3.6.1. _sample_user to be replaced by your user name in C: drive. demo3 to be replaced by the folder path where test.osw is located. Output: Once the simulation is run, go to the demo3 folder (or the folder where you had all the files set up in the local directory) to access the output files as shown in Run the measure section. The generated_files folder would contain the output .osm files, reports that should reflect the Output shown here.\nC. Using OS SDK API Open the Ruby file created in the Call measure via API section.\nCheck Project parameters: Check and update the project parameters in the script as follows:\n# Project parameters default_hvac_bldg_type = \u0026#39;other nonresidential\u0026#39; default_wwr_bldg_type = \u0026#39;Office 5,000 to 50,000 sq ft\u0026#39; default_swh_bldg_type = \u0026#39;Office\u0026#39; climate_zone = \u0026#39;ASHRAE 169-2013-4A\u0026#39; These default values shall be assigned with correct strings. All these strings shall match exactly to the designed list.\nYou can find the full list of strings for each project parameter here\nSet up Directories: There are four directories that must be setup.\nbaseline_dir is the path used by PRM method to save all output files. demo_path is the parent path for demo folder proposed_geo_model is the relative path of proposed model. The path shall be relative to the demo_path user_data_path is the path to user data folder, which contains all the user data .csv. # directories - change these two variables demo_folder = \u0026#39;demo3\u0026#39; proposed_model = \u0026#39;geometry_demo_model.osm\u0026#39; # You may need to change the paths below based on how the project is setup on your local directory: # This path points to a directory that saves all baseline generation outputs baseline_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; # This path points to the parent folder that contains demo1, demo2 or demo3 folder. demo_path = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/source\u0026#34; proposed_geo_model = \u0026#34;/#{demo_folder}/#{proposed_model}\u0026#34; user_data_path = \u0026#34;#{demo_path}/#{demo_folder}/user_data\u0026#34; Initialize: Next we will intialize instances for the baseline generation.\n# Script begins translator = OpenStudio::OSVersion::VersionTranslator.new model = translator.loadModel(\u0026#34;#{demo_path}#{proposed_geo_model}\u0026#34;).get # Generate baseline standard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) model is the proposed model loaded by OpenStudio version translator. standard is the 90.1 PRM 2019 instance of the OpenStudio Standard, which will be used for generating the PRM baseline.\nBaseline generation: The last step is to generate the baseline. Before calling the function, there are a few more steps to do.\nStep 1: Run a simulation on a proposed model. This will generate necessary information for the baseline function Step 2: Convert the user data .csv to .json and load it into the standard instance. Step 3: Call the function to generate baseline model. # Run simulation on proposed model standard.model_run_simulation_and_log_errors(model, run_dir = \u0026#34;#{baseline_dir}/PROP\u0026#34;) # Load User data json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(user_data_path, \u0026#34;#{baseline_dir}\u0026#34;) standard.load_userdata_to_standards_database(json_path) create_results = standard.model_create_prm_stable_baseline_building(model, climate_zone, default_hvac_bldg_type, default_wwr_bldg_type, default_swh_bldg_type, baseline_dir, unmet_load_hours_check=false) You can skip running simulation on proposed model by turning the unmet_load_hours_check flag to true.\nDemo 3 results The WWR on the first floor should be decreased than the WWR on the second and third floor. This is because the ASHRAE 90.1 PRM requires the Retail (strip mall) WWR to be 19%, which is much smaller than the Office 5,000 to 50,000 sq ft (31%).\nBesides WWR, several building system performances are also updated.

The lighting space type is used to determine the baseline lighting power density and lighting control savings based on Table G3.7 of 90.1 Appendix G. The lighting space type is also used for a number of other purposes in the baseline generation, including: determining special requirements for computer rooms and laboratories, identifying residential spaces, and determining applicability of receptacle control measures according to space type.\nThe lighting space type can also be assigned using the User Compliance Data files for Space Type and Space.

Many of them have specific enum values. For a successful generation, these arguments need to match their enum values.\nThis instruction will walk through the argument list, so this API call can be customized for any purpose and building cases.\nThis API function is a primary function to generate baseline models. The process takes a user-created OpenStudio model and several user-defined arguments and produce a PRM baseline model.\nStep 1: Check proposed model graph LR; A(Check proposed model) --\u003e|check severe errors and unmet load hours| B{Decision} B --\u003e|Passed| C(Create four baseline models) B --\u003e|Failed| D(Create one baseline model) The simulation results in this step will be saved in the folder SR_PROP0.\nStep 2: Adjust envelope and internal loads In this step, the function starts adjusting the envelope and internal loads based on the information stored in the method arguments and user-supplied model. In addition, this step also prepares HVAC systems for a sizing run.\ngraph LR; A(Adjust Internal Loads) --\u003e|Remove external shades| B(Shades) A --\u003e|Apply compliacne window to wall ratio| C(WWR) A --\u003e|Apply compliance skylight to root ratio| D(SRR) A --\u003e|Apply compliance lighting power density| E(LPD) A --\u003e|Adjust schedule to handle occupancy sensors| F(Schedule) A --\u003e|Remove daylighting| G(Daylight) A --\u003e|Replace constructions| H(Constructions) A --\u003e|Add HVAC and sizing info| I(HVAC) After all the above is applied, a sizing run is conducted and labeled as SR1 in the output directory.\nStep 3: Fine tune HVAC system parameters 1 Based on the sizing run results in the SR1 folder, this step will fine-tune the HVAC parameters based on the ASHRAE 90.1 appendix G specifications.\ngraph LR; A(HVAC System) --\u003e|Tune baseline air loop fan power| B(Airloop Fans) A --\u003e|Tune baseline zone fan power| C(Zone Fans) A --\u003e|Tune boilers| D(Boilers) A --\u003e|Tune chillers| E(Chllers) A --\u003e|Tune cooling towers| F(CoolingTowers) After all the above steps are completed, a second sizing run is conducted and labeled as SR2 in the output directory. In this run, several key metrics in the HVAC system will be determined, such as the capacity of the chillers and loop flow rates.\nStep 4: Fine tune HVAC system parameters 2 This step further fine-tunes some parameters in the HVAC components. graph LR; A(HVAC Component) --\u003e|Tune component efficiency| B(Efficiency) A --\u003e|Set demand control ventilation| C(DCV) A --\u003e|Tune pump power and controls| D(Pump) A third sizing run is conducted after this step and labeled as SR3 in the output directory. The third sizing run is the final sizing run to refine size-dependent values, including the secondary flow rate in the parallel PIU reheat terminal and the maximum flow rate in the air terminal.\nAfter these four steps, baseline model(s) will be generated in the output directory. The output directory is an argument the user provides when calling this function. In the next section, we will give a detail explanation of these arguments.\n- model model is the OpenStudio model. A typical way to load an OpenStudio model is through the version translator.\nmodel_path = \u0026#39;\\some_path\\some_os_model.osm\u0026#39; translator = OpenStudio::OSVersion::VersionTranslator.new model = translator.loadModel(model_path).get - climate_zone The climate_zone shall be one of the strings from the list below:\nASHRAE 169-2013-0A ASHRAE 169-2013-0B ASHRAE 169-2013-1A ASHRAE 169-2013-1B ASHRAE 169-2013-2A ASHRAE 169-2013-2B ASHRAE 169-2013-3A ASHRAE 169-2013-3B ASHRAE 169-2013-3C ASHRAE 169-2013-4A ASHRAE 169-2013-4B ASHRAE 169-2013-4C ASHRAE 169-2013-5A ASHRAE 169-2013-5B ASHRAE 169-2013-5C ASHRAE 169-2013-6A ASHRAE 169-2013-6B ASHRAE 169-2013-7A ASHRAE 169-2013-7B ASHRAE 169-2013-8A ASHRAE 169-2013-8B - default_hvac_bldg_type The default_hvac_bldg_type shall be one of the strings in the list below:\nheated only storage hospital public assembly retail other nonresidential residential unconditioned - default_wwr_bldg_type The default_wwr_bldg_type shall be one of the strings in the list below:\nWarehouse (nonrefrigerated) School (secondary and university) School (primary) Retail (strip mall) Retail (stand alone) Restaurant (quick service) Restaurant (full serivce) Office \u0026gt; 50,000 sq ft Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft Office 5,000 to 50,000 sq ft Hotel/motel \u0026gt; 75 rooms Hotel/motel \u0026lt;= 75 rooms Hospital Healthcare (outpatient) Grocery store All other - default_swh_bldg_type The default_swh_bldg_type shall be one of the strings in the list below:\nWorkshop Warehouse Transportation Town hall Sport arena School/university Retail Religious facility Post office Police station Performing arts theater Penitentiary Parking garage Office Museum Multifamily Motion picture theater Motel Manufacturing facility Library Hotel Hospital and outpatient surgery center Health-care clinic Gymnasium Grocery store Fire station Exercise center Domitory Dining:Family Dining: Cafeteria/fast food Dining: Bar lounge/leisure Courthouse Convention center Convenience store Automotive facility All others - output_dir output_dir is a mandatory field that specifies the directory to save all sizing runs. When applying the PRM method to a proposed model, OSSTD will perform several sizing runs. These sizing runs are usually saved in a directory specified in sizing_run_dir. In addition, the generated baseline model .idf and .osm will also be saved in this directory.\n- unmet_load_hours unmet_load_hours is a flag that checks whether a model can successfully run an annual simulation and whether its annual unmet load hours meet the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G requirements. The default value for this flag is true.\nCautious when setting the unmet_load_hours to false. This could result in wrong baseline models or crash the baseline generation process.\n- debug debug default is set to false. This argument has no impact on the current PRM generation and is part of the future implementation. Any API calls set this field to false or ignore this argument.\nconvert_userdata_csv_to_json The function converts user data from CSV format to JSON format, and it is typically called before loading the user data before baseline generation.\nstandard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) userdata_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/user_data\u0026#34; output_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; # Converts user data from .csv file to .json file json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(userdata_dir, output_dir) The function has two arguments, userdata_dir and output_dir. The process first loads all the default user data templates as json, then grabs all the user CSV files saved in the userdata_dir and inserts data from the csv files into the json data. Lastly, the function saves the json to the output_dir in the user_data_json folder.\n- userdata_dir This argument shall be a valid directory string that points to the folder where all user data csv is saved. An example can be:\n\u0026#34;C:\\\\documents\\\\my_user_data\u0026#34; - output_dir This argument shall be a valid directory string that points to the folder where all user data json is saved. An example can be:\n\u0026#34;C:\\\\documents\\\\user_data_json\u0026#34; load_userdata_to_standards_database The function loads the user data folder into the 90.1-PRM-2019 instance. A typical workflow will call convert_userdata_csv_to_json first to convert all user data from csv to json and then call load_userdata_to_standards_database to load the json into the workflow.\nstandard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) userdata_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/user_data\u0026#34; output_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; # Converts user data from .csv file to .json file json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(userdata_dir, output_dir) standard.load_userdata_to_standards_database(json_path) json_path shall be a valid directory string that points to the folder where all user data json is saved.\n"

The conditioned type of a zone is determined after model sizing simulation. Therefore, it is critical to note that this function will only work after a successful full-year simulation or sizing run. To do that, follow the script below before calling the function.\n# Initiate the standard to PRM and load the model (model needs to be v3.4 or lower) standard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) translator = OpenStudio::OSVersion::VersionTranslator.new model = translator.loadModel(model_path).get # Make a copy of the model user_model = BTAP::FileIO.deep_copy(model) # Run annual simulation standard.model_run_simulation_and_log_errors(user_model, run_dir = \u0026#34;#{prototype_dir}/PROP\u0026#34;) # Modify the window to wall ratio. result, wwr_info = standard.model_apply_prm_baseline_window_to_wall_ratio(user_model, climate_zone, wwr_building_type: wwr_building_type) If the model is not simulated, this function can still run. However, it will not apply a target WWR to the model because it cannot find any conditioned surface to adjust WWR.\nFunction behavior It is essential to understand the function behaviors before calling this function.\nIf the target WWR is smaller than the model overall WWR, the function will proportionally reduce the size of every window while keeping their center coordinates fixed If the target WWR is greater than the model overall WWR, the function will: remove all windows in surfaces and add new ones to meet the required WWR. This step will only apply to surfaces that have windows Plenums (including air loop supply and return plenums) are not considered in the WWR expanding algorithm. If surfaces with windows reach a 90% WWR, the total gross WWR of the building is still smaller than the target WWR. The function will create new windows on every other surface to meet the target WWR for the building. The size of new windows should be proportional to their host surface. If there are doors on the surface, the maximum WWR for the surface will readjust to ensure the total fenestration area and doors are 90% of the surface area. Input arguments user_model user_model shall be the OpenStudio model object (OpenStudio::Model::Model) that contains a complete description of a building energy model in .osm format.\nclimate_zone climate_zone is a String data. However, it is no longer used in the ASHRAE 90.1 2019 PRM method, so it is OK to type in an empty string.\nwwr_building_type wwr_building_type is a hash key, and the value shall be user-defined. The default is nil. The wwr_building_type shall be a string taken from the list below:\nWarehouse (nonrefrigerated) School (secondary and university) School (primary) Retail (strip mall) Retail (stand alone) Restaurant (quick service) Restaurant (full serivce) Office \u0026gt; 50,000 sq ft Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft Office 5,000 to 50,000 sq ft Hotel/motel \u0026gt; 75 rooms Hotel/motel \u0026lt;= 75 rooms Hospital Healthcare (outpatient) Grocery store All other It is important to keep the wwr_building_type string identical to the list above. Otherwise, the function will set the target building WWR to 40%.\nOutput values result The result is a boolean. true indicates a successful generation and false otherwise.\nwwr_info The wwr_info is a hash map that maps the wwr_building_type to its correspondent target wwr, which is applied when altering the model window-to-wall ratio.\n{\u0026#34;Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft\u0026#34;=\u0026gt;19.0} Multi building area type handling One feature of the PRM routine is the capability of handling multiple building area types in one energy model. For example, if an energy model is simulating a building mixed with retail (strip mall) and offices (\u0026gt;50,000 sq ft). The baseline vertical fenestration percentage requirements differ for these two building area types. Previously, modelers had to manually adjust the generated baseline model to meet the compliance request. In the new workflow, we introduce the user data to handle this situation in the baseline generation runtime.\nCreate user data To do that, we need to create user data. The example we are using is a typical small office model. In this model, we will identify one space as a retail (strip mall) space and the rest are an office (\u0026gt;50,000 sq ft).\nIn this example, we will edit the userdata_space file in a spreadsheet.\nIt is recommended to edit the file in a spreadsheet cause this can avoid any special characters in the string misidentified by the OSSTD-PRM. In this case, Office \u0026gt; 50,000 sq ft can be mis-identified into two columns as Office \u0026gt; 50 and 000 sq ft.\nOnce the user data is set, save the file as a .csv into a user_data folder.\nSet up the script Let\u0026rsquo;s first set up basic data and load the user energy model\n# Set up directories model_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/output\u0026#34; user_model_dir = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/source\u0026#34; user_model_name = \u0026#39;proposed_model.osm\u0026#39; user_data_path = \u0026#34;#{File.dirname(Dir.pwd)}/user_data\u0026#34; # Set up basic parameters climate_zone = \u0026#34;ASHRAE 169-2013-4A\u0026#34; wwr_building_type = \u0026#34;Office \u0026lt;= 5,000 sq ft\u0026#34; # load user model translator = OpenStudio::OSVersion::VersionTranslator.new model = translator.loadModel(\u0026#34;#{user_model_dir}/#{user_model_name}\u0026#34;).get user_model = BTAP::FileIO.deep_copy(model) # Initialize the standard routine standard = Standard.build(\u0026#34;90.1-PRM-2019\u0026#34;) Now we have everything we need, let\u0026rsquo;s load the user data\n# Convert the .csv files into json files and save the json files into model_dir json_path = standard.convert_userdata_csv_to_json(user_data_path, model_dir) # load the user data into standard object instance standard.load_userdata_to_standards_database(json_path) # Add the user data to the user model. standard.handle_multi_building_area_types(user_model, climate_zone, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, wwr_building_type, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, {}) The three lines of code above accomplished three goals:\nConvert the .csv files into JSON files and save the JSON files into model_dir Load the user data into a Standard object instance Call the Standard instance to add user data to the user energy model. The above three steps are crucial to the overall process. The function handle_multi_building_area_types() has six arguments. However, in this example, we only focus on the WWR API function. So supplying user_model, climate_zone, and wwr_building_type and setting the other argument to empty values is sufficient for our next step.\nRun window to wall ratio API # Run a simulation standard.model_run_simulation_and_log_errors(user_model, run_dir = \u0026#34;#{prototype_dir}/PROP\u0026#34;) # Adjust window to wall ratio result, wwr_info = standard.model_apply_prm_baseline_window_to_wall_ratio(user_model, climate_zone, wwr_building_type: wwr_building_type) # Save model user_model.save(OpenStudio::Path.new(\u0026#34;#{prototype_dir}/wwr_output.osm\u0026#34;), true) In the above three lines, the Standard first run an annual simulation of the model to ensure the model is correct and produces a sizing script for analyzing the space conditioning category. Then the model_apply_prm_baseline_window_to_wall_ratio function applies the WWR adjustment to the user energy model.\nOpen the model in the OpenStudio Application, and you can see the Perimeter_ZN_2 space is adjusted to 19% WWR, and the rest are adjusted to 40% WWR.\n"

A sample of data record is shown below.\nend_use_subcategory Each exterior lights object in the model can be assigned up to nine exterior lighting subcategories in the user data file based on Appendix G Table G3.6. The lighting subcategories are designated by the labels:\nend_use_subcategory_01 through end_use_subcategory_09\nIn order to work with the Appendix G code database, the following subcategory names must be used in the user data file:\nTradeable Exterior Lighting Subcategories parking_lots_and_drives_area\nwalkways_less_than_10_ft_wide_perim\nwalkways_10_ft_wide_or_greater_area\nplaza_areas_area\nspecial_feature_areas_area\nstairways_area\nmain_entries_area\nother_doors_perim\ncanopies_area\nopen_areas_including_vehicle_sales_lots_area\nstreet_frontage_for_vehicle_sales_perim\nNon-Tradeable Exterior Lighting Subcategories nontradeable_general_qty\nbuilding_facades_area\nbuilding_facades_perim\nautomated_teller_machines_per_location_qty\nautomated_teller_machines_per_machine_qty\nentries_and_gates_area\nloading_areas_for_emergency_vehicles_area\ndrive_through_windows_and_doors_qty\nparking_near_24_hour_entrances_qty\nroadway_parking_qty\nIt is critical to use the identical string in the above list.

If there is a multiplier in the object, it will be changed to \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; for the baseline model.\nCredit can only be taken for exterior lights that are classified as tradeable. Thus, each exterior lighting object in the model must be configured to represent either only tradeable or only non-tradeable subcategories. If any non-tradeable subcategories are included, the entire object will be treated as non-tradeable for the baseline.\n"
