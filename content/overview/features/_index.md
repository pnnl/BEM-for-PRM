# Key Features of OSSTD-PRM

<!-- {{< line_break >}} -->

Notable features available in the current version of OSSTD-PRM include:

- **Automated 90.1 2019 PRM Generation:** The OSSTD-PRM introduces automated generation of the 90.1 2019 baseline and proposed model, enhancing model accuracy and facilitating model refinement.
- **Code Baseline Generation Flexibility:** The tool offers enhanced flexibility in generating baselines, adapting to diverse project requirements.
- **Precise API Calls:** The OSSTD-PRM provides the capability to make targeted API calls for specific systems, bypassing the need for an entire baseline generation run.
- **Enhanced Data Inclusion:** Through 'rule-set' specific data integrated into the EnergyPlus model (space), the tool effectively addresses mixed typologies. Compliance datasets featured in the user guide section contribute to this versatility.
- **Structured Compliance Data:**  The OSSTD-PRM incorporates 'compliance data' through 16 meticulously curated standardized .csv files with fixed formats, elevating the accuracy of PRM models. Each file corresponds to a specific ASHRAE 90.1-2019 compliance data, seamlessly integrated into OpenStudio objects. This data supplements the ASHRAE 90.1-2019 PRM method with information that extends beyond the scope of the OpenStudio Model, such as motor power details. The guidance to create the .csv files is mentioned in the User Guide section.

<!-- - **Model System Transformation:** Rather than model transformations, the tool focuses on model system transformation, refining the efficiency and accuracy of the process.
