##### Here are some key benefits of using the OSSTD-PRM:

**OpenStudio** provides an **Application Programming Interface (API)** to access the EnergyPlus modeling engine providing some key benefits:
- Stable
- Version controlled interface
- Space typology abstractions 
- Ease for end-users to model buildings
- Accessibility with language bindings in Ruby, Python and C Sharp
- Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful, cross-platform tool that allows users to run OpenStudio based workflows on supported architectures such as Linux, Windows and Mac.

**OpenStudio Measures** is a scripting facility that uses **Ruby ***(and soon to extend support for Python)*** scripts** to automate model queries and transformations and to incrementally extend and customize the platform. These Measures perform transformations that correspond to energy conservation measures—that’s the origin of the name—that range from simple lighting power density reductions to complex and context sensitive daylighting transformations, create custom reports, and link energy simulation to other analyses.

**OSSTD-PRM** 
- Stable platform for existing users and third-party tool while enabling development of new applications
- Improve runtime execution 
- Reduce computation costs
- Improve accessibility of modeling capabilities using SDK, CLI and/or language bindings
- Expand the range of equipment available for simulations
- Provide easier access to analytical tools
- Code, documentation, and discussions related to the software and its documentation are in the open, and the algorithms and procedures used in the software are open to audit and validation
- Transparency in process and development using GitHub and ‘git’ version control
