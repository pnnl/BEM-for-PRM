## What is OSSTD-PRM

The "Create ASHRAE 90.1-2019 PRM Model" measure provides a tool to automatically generate the baseline model according to the rules of the 2019 version of the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Performance Rating Method. 

Since Appendix G began using a "stable baseline" approach beginning with the 2016 version, the 2019 baseline will be nearly the same as the 2016 version. Some differences are outlined [here](/BEM-for-PRM/overview/limtations).

At this time, only a Baseline model is created by the tool. A future version is planned that will also create a Proposed model.
