#### Here are some use cases for the OSSTD-PRM

- **Energy Modelers**

   Energy modelers can utilize the OSSTD-PRM measure to automate the creation of baseline building models. They can also refer to the PRM-RM (Performance Rating Method Reference Manual) for guidelines on how to generate models for proposed designs. This can streamline the energy modeling process and ensure consistency and compliance with relevant standards. 


- **BEM Software Vendors/Developers**

   Building energy modeling software vendors and developers can incorporate the measure and methodology into their workflow to automatically generate baseline building models while ensuring the neutrality of schedules and other modeling assumptions. This integration can be achieved through API calls or by utilizing the open-source code provided.

- **Program Administrators**

   Program administrators, as well as code officials and rating authorities, who manage incentive programs based on the PRM of Standard 90.1, can benefit from using the OSSTD-PRM documentation. This documentation helps them gain a better understanding of the tool and the measures it offers for building modeling requirements. This knowledge can aid in the administration and evaluation of incentive programs, ensuring that the models and assessments are accurate and consistent.


In summary, the OSSTD-PRM serves as a valuable tool for energy modelers, software developers, and program administrators, enabling them to efficiently generate building models, adhere to modeling guidelines, and administer incentive programs that are based on energy performance standards.
