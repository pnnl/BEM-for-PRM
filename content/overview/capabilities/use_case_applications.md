### Here are some use cases for the OSSTD-PRM

{{< line_break >}}

- **Energy Modelers**: can use the OSSTD-PRM measure to automatically generate the baseline building and refer to PRM-RM for rules on generating the model of the proposed design.

- **Software Developers**: Software developers can use the PRM-RM modeling guidelines to customize their software to automatically create the baseline building model and assure that schedules and other modeling assumptions are neutral. The PRM-RM also defines contents for a standard output report that address the reporting requirements as defined for the PRM as well as United States Green Building Councilâ€™s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification

- **Program Administrators**: Program administrators, code officials and rating authorities that administer incentive programs that are based on the PRM of Standard 90.1. Program administrators can use this documentation to better understand the tool and measure for the building modeling requirements.
