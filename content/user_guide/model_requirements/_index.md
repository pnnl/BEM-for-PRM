# Model Requirements

This chapter lists model requirements and best practices for a successful ASHRAE 90.1-2019 PRM model generation.

> In order to run the PRM measure successfully: 
>- The user model should be set up to run a full annual energy simulation (8760 hours) in OpenSudio without any significant errors. That includes having an enclosed space, a valid weather file attached, HVAC systems defined amongst various other requirements. 
>- Unmet load hours should be less than 300 hours out of the 8760 hours simulated unless approved otherwise by the rating authority.
