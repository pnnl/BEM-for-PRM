## D. EQUIPMENT

{{<line_break>}}

Interior equipment includes any equipment that requires electricity, that is not accounted for by HVAC or lighting objects. Receptacle and process loads contribute to heat gains in spaces and directly use energy. Motor elevators, escalators, and moving walkways account for 3%-5% of electric energy in buildings. Refrigeration makes up 10% of commercial building energy use and represents a significant opportunity for energy savings.
