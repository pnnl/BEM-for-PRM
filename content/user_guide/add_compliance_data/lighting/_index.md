## E. LIGHTING

{{<line_break>}}

Lighting in a space or a zone contributes to the internal heat gains of the building. To properly account for the whole building's electricity consumption, both lighting energy use along with the heat generated by them (which subsequently affects zone heating or cooling requirements) must be considered. Lighting calculations typically include all components including lamps, ballasts, task and furniture-mounted fixtures etc.
