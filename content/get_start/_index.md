# Get Started

Start using OpenStudio Standard to create ASHRAE 90.1-2019 PRM models in your compliance modeling workflow. 

There are a few approaches for the setup that include:
1. [**Use with OS App**](/BEM-for-PRM/get_start/os_app/) : The OpenStudio Application (OS App), managed by [OpenStudio Coalition](https://openstudiocoalition.org/), provides a graphical user interface to the OpenStudio engine. 

2. [**Use with OS SDK using CLI**](/BEM-for-PRM/get_start/os_cli) : The OpenStudio Software Development Kit (OS SDK), managed by [NREL](https://openstudio.net/), provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to access OpenStudio's functionality.

3. [**Use with OS SDK API**](/BEM-for-PRM/get_start/os_engine) :  OpenStudio SDK provides an Application Programming Interface (API) to access the EnergyPlus modeling engine. This interface provides language bindings in Ruby, Python and C-Sharp to make it more accessible to users familiar with these languages.
