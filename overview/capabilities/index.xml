      <description> Appendix G Performance Rating Method Rules and OSSTD-PRM The &amp;ldquo;Create ASHRAE 90.1-2019 PRM Model&amp;rdquo; measure provides a detailed implementation of the rules of the Appendix G Performance Rating Method. Below are some of the key changes that are applied by the tool when creating the Baseline and Proposed model:
Rules for Baseline Model Apply baseline envelope rules Space conditioning type Constructions Insulation levels Window-to-wall ratio Skylight-to-roof ratio Infiltration Apply baseline lighting rules Lighting power Lighting occupancy sensor control Determine and create baseline HVAC systems Remove user model HVAC Determine baseline HVAC based on building type and Appendix G rules Create new baseline HVAC systems Apply special rules for computer rooms and laboratories Size HVAC systems Apply HVAC efficiencies Apply fan power adjustments Apply baseline HVAC controls Rotate building model through cardinal directions Check for unmet load hours and rectify, if needed Handle additional compliance data Multiple building types Plug load measures Elevators Exterior lighting Interior lighting exceptions Number of systems per zone Rules for Proposed Model Apply proposed envelope rules Infiltration Apply proposed lighting rules Residential lighting power Remove pipe losses for SWH Adjust computer room equipment schedules </description>

      <description>Here are some use cases for the OSSTD-PRM Energy Modelers
Energy modelers can utilize the OSSTD-PRM measure to automate the creation of baseline and proposed building models. This can streamline the energy modeling process and ensure consistency and compliance with relevant standards.
BEM Software Vendors/Developers
Building energy modeling software vendors and developers can incorporate the measure and methodology into their workflow to automatically generate baseline and proposed building models while ensuring the neutrality of schedules and other modeling assumptions.</description>
